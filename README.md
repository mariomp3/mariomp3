# Mario Moda Piva

Although I wear glasses, I see patterns in data that most people don't.

During my career, I acquired great knowledge in materials science. Studying them generated a lot of data and analyzing it greatly enhanced my data science skills and programming skills (Matlab, python, SQL, PowerBI). I mentored and trained many students in conducting scientific research, presentations, and technical writing. Also, I had the opportunity to visit many laboratories and institutes around the world. These experiences greatly enhanced my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
